## 💡 How does it work?

I followed Django's **MVC** pattern:

- **Models**: Define the contact structure (name, email, phone, etc).
- **Views**: Handle adding, editing, deleting, and searching contacts.
- **Templates**: Render the HTML pages for users.

Only registered users can manage their contacts thanks to authentication.  
Searching uses database filters, so it's fast and efficient.

## 🚀 How to use

Just go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and start managing your contacts!  
The interface is intuitive and responsive to make your life easier.
